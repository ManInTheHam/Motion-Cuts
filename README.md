    In Task 3 we build Expense Tracker using Python 
    Here, I have used different types of Python libraries i.e datetime , collections , json
    
    datetime:The datetime module in Python provides classes for working with dates and times. It allows the creation and manipulation of datetime objects, facilitating tasks like date arithmetic and formatting.
    
    collections:The collections module includes specialized container datatypes that extend the capabilities of built-in types. Notable classes like defaultdict and Counter provide enhanced functionalities for dictionary-like structures and counting elements.
    
    json:The json module in Python facilitates encoding and decoding JSON data. This module is commonly used for data interchange between different systems.
